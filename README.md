# Dewey Framework

An open-source, agent-based AI educational framework for creating intelligent learning tools and systems. Named after educational philosopher John Dewey, this framework orchestrates specialized AI agents to deliver personalized, interactive educational experiences across disciplines.

## Overview

The Dewey framework is an open-source platform for AI-powered educational intelligence. This experimental project creates an ecosystem of specialized educational agents orchestrated by a central coordination layer to transform learning experiences for students, educators, and professionals.

Led by Professor Nik Bear Brown, PhD, MBA, this educational experiment emphasizes learning through building, inviting contributors to discover effective approaches through practical implementation rather than claiming definitive solutions.

## Agent-Based Architecture

The Dewey framework organizes specialized agents into categories, each focused on different aspects of the educational experience:

### 1. Content Generation Agents
Create personalized learning materials, intelligent AI books, and dynamic educational content tailored to individual learning styles and needs.

### 2. Tutorial Agents
Guide learners through complex topics with step-by-step explanations, Socratic questioning, and adaptive scaffolding techniques.

### 3. Assessment Agents
Analyze learner performance, provide formative feedback, and adapt content difficulty based on demonstrated understanding.

### 4. Simulation Agents
Create interactive learning environments, algorithm visualizations, and scientific simulations for hands-on experiential learning.

### 5. Mentor Agents
Provide personalized guidance, encouragement, and metacognitive support throughout the learning journey.

### 6. Career Development Agents
Assist with resume optimization, mock interviews, and professional skill development for job readiness.

## The Dewey Orchestration Layer

At the heart of the framework is the Dewey orchestration layer, which coordinates the activities of specialized agents to create cohesive educational experiences:

- **Cross-Agent Validation**: Ensures consistency across educational content and experiences created by different agents.

- **Dynamic Task Allocation**: Assigns educational tasks to specialized agents based on learner needs and educational objectives.

- **Learning Pathway Optimization**: Creates personalized learning journeys based on individual goals, prior knowledge, and learning styles.

- **Continuous Assessment**: Monitors learner progress and adjusts content delivery in real-time based on performance and engagement.

- **Ethical Guardrails**: Maintains educational integrity by ensuring AI assists learning rather than bypassing it.

## Current Key Projects

### Intelligent AI Books (Medhavi)
Transforming learning through personalized conversational AI books that adapt content to individual learners. Unlike static textbooks, these AI-powered books engage in dynamic dialogue, adjusting explanations based on the learner's background, progress, and questions.

**Implementation Process**:
1. Generate complete learning resources from a simple Table of Contents
2. Integrate multimedia content including simulations, code examples, and dynamic graphs
3. Personalize learning paths based on real-time interaction and assessment
4. Enable professors to upload course materials for AI alignment with teaching style

### Botspeak
A comprehensive program teaching people how to effectively communicate with Large Language Models (LLMs) through YouTube videos, workshops, and interactive tutorials, democratizing access to AI capabilities.

**Implementation Process**:
1. Develop practical tutorials on effective prompting techniques
2. Create hybrid learning experiences combining videos and hands-on practice
3. Bridge the gap between technical and non-technical users
4. Empower individuals to leverage AI capabilities through improved communication

### Case Crackers
An AI platform revolutionizing management education by generating customized case studies, simulating realistic case interviews, and providing business solution frameworks.

**Implementation Process**:
1. Generate sector-specific case studies with customizable difficulty levels
2. Create interactive interview simulations with AI interviewer and candidate roles
3. Provide structured business solutions with frameworks and visualizations
4. Break down barriers to accessibility in management education

### Subject-Specific Educational Chatbots

The Dewey framework supports the development of specialized educational chatbots tailored to specific academic disciplines:

- **Ada**: A calculus learning assistant providing step-by-step guidance through complex mathematical concepts
- **Newton**: A physics chatbot incorporating dynamic simulations to visualize scientific principles
- **Grace**: An algorithms chatbot that simulates computational processes with interactive visualizations

### Crispus Project
A collaborative initiative pairing recent Master's graduates with high school and undergraduate students to build AI tools that enhance learning rather than replacing homework effort.

**Implementation Process**:
1. Match mentors with students to identify educational challenges
2. Design and build tools focusing on deeper understanding
3. Test learning tools in real educational environments
4. Document and share successful projects with the community

## Implementation Considerations

### Integration Approaches
1. **API-Based Integration**: Connects agents to existing educational tools and Learning Management Systems via RESTful APIs.
2. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Incorporates educator oversight for content validation and pedagogical alignment.
3. **Phased Rollout**: Starts with high-impact educational agents and scales to others as the framework matures.
4. **Hybrid Deployment**: Supports cloud, on-premises, or hybrid environments for flexibility in educational settings.

### Success Factors
1. **Pedagogical Foundations**: Ensures educational best practices inform agent design and interaction patterns.
2. **Ethical Guardrails**: Maintains focus on learning enhancement rather than assignment completion.
3. **Feedback Loops**: Implements continuous improvement based on learning outcomes and user experience.
4. **Accessibility**: Prioritizes inclusive design for learners of diverse backgrounds, abilities, and learning styles.

### Socratic Teaching Emphasis

The Dewey framework places special emphasis on creating and verifying educational tools that facilitate hands-on, Socratic teaching approaches. Our agents are specifically designed to:

- **Ask guiding questions** rather than providing direct answers
- **Encourage critical thinking** through carefully scaffolded challenges
- **Personalize learning pathways** based on individual responses and understanding
- **Verify comprehension** through strategic questioning and adaptive assessment
- **Make educational content interactive** through simulations and visualizations
- **Create dynamic learning environments** that respond to learner curiosity

This focus on Socratic methodology ensures that our educational tools support deep understanding rather than surface-level knowledge acquisition, aligning with John Dewey's philosophy that education should be experiential and learner-centered.
